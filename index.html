        <h1>&#128512;World Happiness (2015-2022)&#128512;</h1>
        <h3>By Sami Hussein Hamid Saeed</h3>
        <p>An analysis of the Happiness levels around the world and the various factors that affect it, 
          gathered from several different data sources and collected from citizens from each country.
          The Happiness Index measures life satisfaction, the feeling of happiness, and other happiness domains such as:
          health, finanical status, government trust, freedom, generosity, and family.

          <h2>Happiness World Map</h2>
          <p>Using the following map you can view the change in happiness in the entire worldthroughout the years 2015 to 2022,
            using the filters you can also limit the data to show the top 10 or 100 happiest countries for any year. From the map 
            bellow we can analyse that on average, the happiest countries in the world tend to be in <span class = "europe">Europe</span> and <span class = "oceania">Oceania</span>, this could 
            be attributed to the significantly advanced quality of life, government trust, economical stability, and high health standards 
            in these continents. Furthermore, <span class = "northA">North America</span> and <span class = "southA">South America</span> both have a consistently good happiness score throughout the years 2015-2022, although
            over the years, the happiness levels in <span class = "southA">South America</span> have somewhat detoriorated. Finally, the happiness levels in <span class = "asia">Asia</span> and especially <span class = "africa">Africa</span> are one of
            lowest levels in the entire world, regardless of the year.

          <h2>Happiest Countries Of The World</h2>
          <p>
            From the country rankings bellow we can observe that the happiest countries in the world are mostly from <span class = "oceania">Oceania</span> and <span class = "europe">Europe</span> (mainly Scandanavia). Another
            interesting observation is that for the years 2015 to 2021, no countries from <span class = "asia">Asia</span>, <span class = "africa">Africa</span>, or <span class = "southA">South America</span> made it into the leaderboard. But in 2022, Israel
            has made it into the leaderboard, representing <span class = "asia">Asia</span>. Finally, until the year 2019 Canada was the only country from <span class = "northA">North America</span> to make it into the top 10 happiest
            countries in the world.

          <h2>Happiest Countries In Each Continent</h2>
          <p>As shown in the lollipop chart to the right, we can observe the change in happiness levels for each specific continent throughout
            the years 2015 to 2022. <br><br>Firstly, in <span class = "northA">North America</span>, Canada is consistently the most happiest country in the continent and although the United States
            is the most famous country in <span class = "northA">North America</span> it pales in comparision to Canada and Costa Rica (2015-2021).
            Even though <span class = "europe">Europe</span> has one of the highest happiness averages, it is actually mainly because of the presence of Scandanavian countries.
            In <span class = "asia">Asia</span>, Israel is always the happiest country in the continent, the rest of the countries are mostly middle eastern countries.<br><br>
            Moreover, the data available for <span class = "oceania">Oceania</span> is only for Australia and New Zealand, therefore <span class = "oceania">Oceania</span> has a consistently high happiness level.
            Contrary to popular belief <span class = "southA">South America</span> actually has a surprisingly high happiness average.
            Finally, <span class = "africa">Africa</span> has the lowest levels of happiness amongst all of the continents.

            Overall, we can observe a positive change in the happiness levels for each continent, with the

            In addition, <span class = "southA">South America</span>'s happiness score has also decreased from <span class = "southA">6.35</span> in the year 2015 to

            <h2>Key Happiness Factors</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of factors that affect the happiness levels of a country, such as: economy, freedom, health, generosity, family, and trust in government.
              In order to further analyse the relationships between these factors and happiness. In general <span class = "europe">Europe</span>,  <span class = "oceania">Oceania</span>
              , and <span class = "southA">South America</span> tend to have a high happiness score, whereas <span class = "northA">North America</span>, <span class = "asia">Asia</span>

        <h2>Generosity</h2>
        <p>The extent to which Generosity contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score. Generosity will 
          increase the psychological well being of everyone involved while also having an impact on material 
          wellbeing, which are two of the domains of Gross National Happiness. If we want there to be change

        <p>The extent to which Perception of Corruption contributes to Happiness Score. Happier countries tend to
          have a high level of trust in their respective governments, this is mainly because these governments are providing for their
          citizens and are hence proving to their people that they are worthy of their trust. The people of a country 
          must be able to rely on and trust their leaders and governments in order to lead a stress free way of life.

        <p>The extent to which Perception of Freedom in a country contributes to Happiness Score.Freedom is important 
          for our happiness because it allows us to make choices that make us happy and gives us the opportunity to make
           mistakes and learn from them. So our happiness depends on how we feel about the choices we've made and continue
           to make in life.

              <p>The extent to which health and life expectancy contributes to Happiness Score.The countries that score
                 high on the quality and accessibility of their often freely available healthcare generally all score 
                 high on the happiness index. Most of the happiest countries in the world providy easily available healthcare
                and ackowledge healthcare as a basic human right, rather than a commerical industry.</p>

                 well being within the family and in each family member. Wellbeing includes a person's physical, mental,
                  emotional and social health. Strong, happy families encourage and support each other to be optimistic,

              <p>The extent to which economy contributes to Happiness Score. The economy of a country plays a significantly important
                role in the happiness of the country, this is mainly due to the ability of wealthy countries to facilitate their citizens
                and satisfy their needs. People in wealthier countries with high-quality institutions tend to be happier than people in 
                countries with less wealth and poorer institutions.
